# CHANGELOG (autogenerated)

Generated: 2025-12-31

Summary of edits applied during session:

- Build & correctness
  - Fixed compile error and multiple nullability warnings across service and engine code.
  - Files adjusted: `ChangeLog.cs`, `ServiceExecutor.cs`, `PolicyEngineCore.cs` (null-safety, defensive checks).

- Tooling & CI
  - Added `.editorconfig` and GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` to run restore/build/test.
  - Improved `README.md` with build/run instructions.

- UI / Avalonia changes
  - Introduced theming resources: `Styles/ThemeResources.Light.axaml` and `ThemeResources.Dark.axaml`.
  - Added `Styles/ControlStyles.axaml` and `Styles/IconStyles.axaml` for control visuals and icon styles.
  - Rewired `App.axaml` to include theme and style resources and runtime theme swapping support.
  - Updated `MainWindow` and multiple views (`PolicySelectionView.axaml`, `AuditView.axaml`, `DiffView`) with visual improvements.
  - Virtualized long lists by switching ItemsControl -> ListBox + `VirtualizingStackPanel` for policy and audit lists.
  - Replaced inline emoji labels with icon font placeholders and added an icon font scaffold.

- Fonts & icons
  - Added `Assets/Fonts/` with helper script `scripts/download-icon-font.ps1` and downloaded `MaterialIconsOutlined-Regular.otf`.
  - Wired `AppIconFontFamily` into theme resources and `IconStyles.axaml` to enable icon glyph usage.

- Scripts & UX
  - Hardened launch scripts: `LaunchGUI.ps1` (param parsing, build checks, background launch) and `LaunchGUI.bat`.

- Misc
  - Created `CHANGELOG_AUTOGEN.md` (this file).

Build verification
- Performed repeated builds during session; final verification: `dotnet build PrivacyHardeningFramework.sln -c Release` succeeded.

Next suggested steps
- Run `dotnet format` and static analyzers (optional) to enforce code style.
- Add accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, focus visuals, high-contrast) across UI controls.
- Review and approve icon glyph mappings, or replace semantic names with explicit codepoints if needed.

If you want, I can now run `dotnet format` and add a small icon mapping helper control to centralize glyph usage.
