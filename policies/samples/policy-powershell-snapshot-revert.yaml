category: sample
risk: low
applicability:
  - all
mechanism:
  type: PowerShell
  details:
    ScriptPath: "samples/main_example.ps1"        # main script to apply (not provided here - replace with real script)
    SnapshotScriptPath: "samples/snapshot_example.ps1"
    RevertScriptPath: "samples/revert_example.ps1"
