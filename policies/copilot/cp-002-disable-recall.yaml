category: Copilot
description: |
  Disables Windows Recall feature that takes periodic screenshots of your
  screen activity for AI analysis and searchable history.

  Recall captures:
  - Screenshots every few seconds
  - All visible screen content
  - Application windows and text
  - Websites you visit
  - Documents you view
  - Everything visible on screen

  This data is analyzed by local AI and made searchable.

  Privacy concern - CRITICAL:
  Even though processed locally, Recall creates a comprehensive
  surveillance database of everything you do on your computer.

  Disabling prevents this pervasive monitoring.

  CRITICAL PRIVACY CONCERN:
  Windows Recall is one of the most invasive privacy features ever
  introduced in Windows.

  What Recall captures:
  - Periodic screenshots of your entire screen
  - All text visible in any application
  - Websites you browse (including private browsing)
  - Documents you view or edit
  - Passwords/sensitive info if visible on screen
  - Video calls and conferences
  - Private messages and emails
  - Financial information on screen

  Even though local:
  - Creates comprehensive activity database
  - Screenshots stored on device (security risk if compromised)
  - AI analyzes all content locally
  - Searchable history of everything you've done

  Security risks:
  - Malware could access Recall database
  - Screenshots may contain sensitive data
  - Forensic evidence of all activities
  - Family/coworkers could access your history

  STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Disable Recall for privacy and security.

  Alternative: Use manual screenshots or screen recording when needed.

  ⚠️ CRITICAL PRIVACY FEATURE ⚠️

  Windows Recall takes screenshots of your screen every few seconds
  and stores them in a searchable database.

  This creates a complete record of:
  - Every document you open
  - Every website you visit
  - Every application you use
  - Every conversation you have
  - Everything visible on your screen

  Privacy implications:
  - Comprehensive surveillance of your computer use
  - Screenshots stored locally (accessible if PC compromised)
  - Potential exposure of passwords, financial data, private communications
  - Forensic evidence of all activities

  Security implications:
  - Malware could steal Recall database
  - Others with access to your PC could view your history
  - Screenshots may capture sensitive information

  Strongly consider disabling Recall unless you specifically need
  the ability to search your past screen activity.

  Your screen activity should be private by default.
