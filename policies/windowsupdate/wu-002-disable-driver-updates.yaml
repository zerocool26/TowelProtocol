name: "Disable Automatic Driver Updates via Windows Update"
category: WindowsUpdate
description: |
  Prevents Windows Update from automatically downloading and installing device drivers.

  When enabled, Windows will NOT:
  - Download driver updates from Windows Update
  - Install drivers automatically during Windows Updates
  - Replace manufacturer drivers with Microsoft-provided drivers

  You retain full control over driver installation and can:
  - Install drivers manually from manufacturer websites
  - Use Device Manager to control driver updates
  - Prevent potentially problematic driver auto-installation

  Privacy consideration: Driver updates may contain telemetry components.
  Stability consideration: Some automatic driver updates cause hardware issues.

notes: |
  Low risk: Manual driver management is often preferred by advanced users.

  Benefits of disabling automatic driver updates:
  - Prevent buggy driver auto-installation
  - Use manufacturer drivers instead of generic Microsoft drivers
  - Control when driver changes occur
  - Prevent driver-related telemetry installation

  Use cases:
  - Gaming systems (stable drivers critical)
  - Professional audio/video workstations
  - Systems with specialized hardware
  - Users who prefer manufacturer drivers

  You can still manually update drivers via:
  - Device Manager
  - Manufacturer software (NVIDIA GeForce Experience, etc.)
  - Direct downloads from manufacturer websites
