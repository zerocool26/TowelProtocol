helpText: |
  This policy prevents Windows from automatically installing apps you didn't request
  and showing promotional content. This improves privacy by preventing unwanted data
  collection related to app suggestions and usage tracking.

  Trade-off: You won't see suggested apps, but you can still manually search and install
  any app from the Microsoft Store.
