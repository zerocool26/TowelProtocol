notes: |
  Low risk: No functional impact, only reduces telemetry.

  Privacy benefit:
  - OneDrive client doesn't send usage statistics
  - No tracking of feature usage
  - No crash report uploads
  - Fewer telemetry connections to Microsoft

  Recommended: Enable for all privacy-conscious configurations.
  This has no functional downside and improves privacy.

  Combine with Windows telemetry policies for comprehensive telemetry reduction.
