notes: |
  Low risk: Convenience feature, not essential browser functionality.

  Privacy concern - MEDIUM:
  Edge shopping features track:
  - Which products you view
  - Product pages you visit
  - Shopping sites you use
  - Price points you're interested in
  - Purchase patterns
  - Product categories you browse

  This data is sent to Microsoft to:
  - Build shopping profile
  - Provide recommendations
  - Track consumer behavior
  - Potentially share with retailers

  Privacy recommendation:
  Disable unless you actively want Microsoft tracking your shopping.

  Alternative:
  Use browser extensions like Honey or manual coupon sites for deals
  without integrated browser tracking.
