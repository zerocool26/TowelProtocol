name: "Disable Edge Address Bar Search Suggestions"
category: Edge
description: |
  Disables search suggestions in Microsoft Edge address bar.

  When disabled:
  - No suggestions sent to search engine as you type
  - Address bar doesn't send partial queries to Bing
  - Local history/bookmarks still suggest, but no cloud queries
  - Reduces telemetry about what you're searching for

  Privacy benefit:
  Your partial search queries not sent to Microsoft before you press Enter.

  Convenience loss:
  No real-time search suggestions as you type.

  Low risk: Convenience feature only.

  Privacy concern with search suggestions:
  Every keystroke in address bar is sent to Microsoft/Bing:
  - "how to h..." (sent to Bing)
  - "how to hack..." (sent to Bing)
  - "how to hack windows..." (sent to Bing)

  Microsoft sees ALL partial searches, not just completed ones.

  This reveals:
  - What you're thinking about searching
  - Topics you're interested in but don't complete
  - Sensitive searches you start but abandon
  - Your typing patterns and search behavior

  Privacy recommendation:
  Disable if you want private browsing. Local history suggestions
  still work (from your own bookmarks/history).

  Alternative:
  Use DuckDuckGo or StartPage as default search engine for
  additional privacy (doesn't prevent this telemetry though).
