notes: |
  Low risk: Disables tracking, no functional impact.

  What Edge personalizes when enabled:
  - New Tab page content
  - Suggested sites
  - News feed articles
  - Shopping recommendations
  - Advertisement targeting
  - Search suggestions

  All based on your browsing history and behavior.

  Privacy impact - HIGH:
  Microsoft builds advertising profile of your browsing habits including:
  - Sites you visit
  - Topics you read about
  - Products you view
  - Search queries
  - Time spent on different content

  Recommended: ALWAYS disable personalization.
  Generic content is fine, tracking is not.
