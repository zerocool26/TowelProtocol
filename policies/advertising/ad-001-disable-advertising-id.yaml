  The Advertising ID is a unique identifier Windows assigns to your account for
  ad tracking purposes. Apps and advertisers use it to:

  - Track your behavior across multiple apps
  - Build a profile of your interests
  - Show targeted advertisements
  - Share data with advertising networks

  Privacy Impact of Disabling:
  ✓ Apps cannot track you across different applications
  ✓ Advertisers cannot build detailed profile about you
  ✓ Less data shared with advertising networks
  ✓ Reduces cross-app surveillance

  Functionality Impact:
  - You'll still see ads, but they won't be personalized
  - Ads may be less relevant to your interests

  This is a recommended privacy improvement with minimal functionality impact.
