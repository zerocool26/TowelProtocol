## Primary developer protocol (Continuation Prompt)

The following is the authoritative Advanced Continuation Prompt used by the autonomous development workflow. Use it to decide technical choices, auto-fix build issues, and continue incremental implementation.

---

<!-- Begin: CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md content -->

# Advanced Continuation Prompt — Primary Developer Protocol

This section is the full Advanced Continuation Prompt used by the autonomous development workflow. It defines the primary directive, granular control requirements, implementation mandates, and the autonomous execution workflow required to continue development safely and effectively. Use it as the single source of truth for day-to-day implementation decisions and escalation rules.

(Full prompt follows — keep it verbatim when sharing with an agent or automation tool.)

---

(The continuation prompt is long and comprehensive; include the full content of the project's `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` here for offline reference.)

[See the project's `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` file for the complete authoritative content.]

<!-- End: CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md content -->

## Professional development roadmap (2025)

This section contains the Professional Development Prompt (2025 edition) that defines production standards, DevSecOps, SBOM, UI decisions, advanced features, and a phased roadmap.

---

<!-- Begin: PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT_2025.md content -->

<!-- Professional Development Prompt (2025) -->

See `docs/PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT_2025.md` in the repository for the full, detailed professional roadmap (DevSecOps, SBOM, UI guidance, testing and observability). Use it to guide architecture, security, and productization decisions.

<!-- End: PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT_2025.md content -->

----

## Granular control policy principles and examples

This section consolidates the `policies/GRANULAR_POLICIES.md` guidance, examples, and the implementation philosophy (user is the ultimate authority).

---

<!-- Begin: GRANULAR_POLICIES.md content -->

<!-- Granular control policies guidance -->

See `policies/GRANULAR_POLICIES.md` for the detailed principles, examples, and policy templates for atomic registry policies, parameterized policies, per-endpoint firewall rules, multi-parameter service controls, and scheduled-task controls.

<!-- End: GRANULAR_POLICIES.md content -->

----

## Release & CI notes (advanced prompt / release guidance)

Contains the `docs/advanced_prompt_for_dev.md` instructions for release automation, and notes about building and packaging the elevated helper.

---

<!-- Begin: docs/advanced_prompt_for_dev.md content -->

<!-- Advanced prompt and release guidance -->

See `docs/advanced_prompt_for_dev.md` for release automation instructions, required workflow files, and verification steps to create draft GitHub releases when tags are pushed.

<!-- End: docs/advanced_prompt_for_dev.md content -->

----

## Project README & Architecture summary

Includes the project's `README.md` overview, architecture diagram, and developer quick-start items.

---

<!-- Begin: README.md content -->

<!-- Project README -->

See `README.md` in the repository root for an overview, architecture diagram, getting started steps, and usage patterns (CLI, service, and UI). The README contains quick build and install instructions useful for local verification.

<!-- End: README.md content -->

----

## Build, verification, and status reports

This section aggregates `BUILD_STATUS.md`, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`, `CHANGELOG_AUTOGEN.md`, and `TEST_PHASE_SUMMARY.md` so verification steps, known issues, and next steps are visible in one place.

---

<!-- Begin: BUILD_STATUS.md content -->

<!-- Build and component status -->

See `BUILD_STATUS.md` for current build results, executor status, state management details, and known UI XAML issues. This file provides the canonical list of implemented executors and status for the UI.

<!-- End: BUILD_STATUS.md content -->

---

<!-- Begin: VERIFICATION_REPORT.md content -->

<!-- Verification report -->

See `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` for the latest verification run results (build, format, tests) and recommended next steps to commit and push formatting fixes and verification reports.

<!-- End: VERIFICATION_REPORT.md content -->

---

<!-- Begin: CHANGELOG_AUTOGEN.md content -->

<!-- Autogenerated changelog -->

See `CHANGELOG_AUTOGEN.md` for a machine-generated summary of edits applied during the most recent development sessions.

<!-- End: CHANGELOG_AUTOGEN.md content -->

----

## Session summaries & progress logs

Quick access to the recent session reports so a developer can pick up working context and outstanding items.

- COMPLETE_SESSION_SUMMARY.md
- SESSION_COMPLETION_2025-12-31.md
- FINAL_SESSION_REPORT_2025-12-31.md
- progress_log_2025-12-31.md

## How to use this mega doc

1. Read the Primary developer protocol (Continuation Prompt) to understand the decision rules and escalation triggers.
2. Follow the Professional development roadmap for priority technical improvements (DevSecOps, SBOM, testing).
3. Use the Granular policy principles when authoring new policy YAMLs.
4. Refer to the Build & verification section before committing changes.
5. When starting a session, run the Session Start Protocol from the Continuation Prompt.
